                <h3>The age and intensity of an autism diagnosis can vary a lot. Some infants show signs in the first few months, while others show signs around ages 2-3.
                Not all children with autism show all the signs. In contrast, neurotypical kids may also show some signs associated with autism. Because of this, it's critical to have a professional assess the child.
                These symptoms below may indicate that your child is on the spectrum for autism
