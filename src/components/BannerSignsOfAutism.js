                <h1>The Signs Autism</h1>
                <h4>The age and intensity of autism diagnosis can vary a lot. Some infants show signs in the first few months, while others show signs around ages 2-3.
                Not all children with autism show all the signs. In contrast, neurotypical kids may also show some signs associated with autism. That is the reason it's critical to have a professional analyze the child.
                These symptoms below may indicate that your child is on the spectrum for autism.
