                    These influences mentioned below seem to increase the likelihood that a child will develop autism.
                    It is vital, however, to remember that just because there's a risk doesn't mean it's the cause. For example, several gene changes associated with autism may also be in individuals who do not have the disorder. Likewise, not everybody exposed to an environmental risk factor for autism is going to develop the disorder
