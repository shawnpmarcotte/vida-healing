                                <li> • A common question that comes after an autism diagnosis is, "What's the root cause of autism?"
The best studies on the topic suggest autism comes from a mix of genetic and nongenetic/environmental factors. </li>
                                <li> • These mentioned influences seem to increase the likelihood that a child will develop autism.
                It is vital, however, to remember that just because there's a risk doesn't mean it's the cause. For example, several gene changes associated with autism may also be in individuals who do not have the disorder. Likewise, not everybody exposed to an environmental risk factor for autism is going to develop the disorder. Many won't.</li>

If one of the parents has one or more of the genes in question, there's a likelihood they'll get transferred to a kid (even if the parent doesn't have autism). Sometimes, these genetic changes occur in embryos spontaneously. Most of the genes don't guarantee autism, but they do increase the risk.</h4>

                                <li> • Vaccines. Every family has a unique situation with their autism diagnose(es); for some, it corresponds with their child's vaccine timing. Researchers have done a lot of research over the past few years to determine whether there's some link between childhood vaccinations and autism</li>
                                <li> • The outcomes have shown that autism isn't caused by vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics has assembled a thorough list of their analysis on this topic</li>
